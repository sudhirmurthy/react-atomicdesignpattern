Atomic Design Pattern Example for ReactJS Application

Atomic design, developed by Brad Frost and Dave Olsen, is a methodology for crafting design systems with five fundamental building blocks, which, when combined, promote consistency, modularity, and scalability. In this post, we’re going to explore how these principles are a natural fit for building interfaces in React, and how we can extend the Atomic metaphor in useful ways such that we can map out components which have a dynamic lifecycle inside of an abstract ecosystem.

The five distinct levels of atomic design — atoms > molecules > organisms > templates > pages — map incredibly well to React’s component-based architecture.
